The files Circle, Cube, Ellipsoid are able to simulate/generate a volume with bodies.
The helper file is only for the euler angles and exist just for ludicity.

To use the Circle, Cube or Ellipsoid class just run it.
The size of the volume, size of bodies and count of bodies can be changed in each file.

Notice! If to many bodies are made (or just when the random placement is unlucky), the code will dismiss some of them, if the new body would overlap onto another one.
If you want to force the amount of bodies, just set "i" back by one each time an overlap is happening. This however could result in the code running forever.
